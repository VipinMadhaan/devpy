list:
  - label: "What services do you offer?"
    content: "I offer a range of services including Full-Stack Development (Vue.js, React, Node.js), Technical Consulting, Project Leadership, Code Review & Mentoring, Browser Extension Development, and API Development & Integration. We can discuss your specific needs to tailor a service package."
  - label: "What is your typical development process and how are clients involved?"
    content: "My process involves: Discovery (understanding your requirements and business goals), Planning (detailed project scope, timeline, and deliverables, including cost estimates), Development (agile sprints with regular client demos and feedback sessions), and Delivery (thorough testing, deployment, and comprehensive handover with documentation). Client involvement is crucial at each stage to ensure alignment and satisfaction."
  - label: "What are your pricing models and payment terms?"
    content: "Pricing varies by project complexity and engagement model. I offer hourly rates for smaller tasks or ongoing support, and fixed-price quotes for well-defined projects. For larger projects, we can discuss milestone-based payments. A typical payment schedule involves an upfront deposit (e.g., 30-50%), milestone payments, and a final payment upon project completion and acceptance. Detailed terms will be outlined in the project proposal."
  - label: "Which technologies do you specialize in for Full-Stack Development?"
    content: "I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks and technologies including Vue.js (with Nuxt.js), React (with Next.js), Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I'm also adaptable to other technologies based on project requirements."
  - label: "Can you help with an existing project or only new ones? What about project rescue?"
    content: "I can assist with both new projects from scratch and existing projects that need new features, refactoring, or performance improvements. I also offer project rescue services for projects that are struggling, helping to get them back on track by identifying issues and implementing solutions."
  - label: "How do I get started on a project with you, and what's the initial consultation like?"
    content: "The best way to start is by contacting me with a brief overview of your project. We'll then schedule a free initial consultation (typically 30-60 minutes) to discuss your requirements, goals, timeline, and budget in more detail. This helps us determine if we're a good fit and allows me to prepare a tailored proposal."
  - label: "Do you offer ongoing support and maintenance, and what are the terms?"
    content: "Yes, I offer ongoing support and maintenance retainers or ad-hoc support charged at an hourly rate. Terms for retainers, including response times and scope of work, are customized based on your needs and agreed upon in a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA)."
  - label: "What kind of technical consulting do you provide, and how can it benefit my project's timeline and budget?"
    content: "My technical consulting includes technology stack selection, architectural design reviews, code audits, performance optimization, and scalability planning. Effective consulting can prevent costly mistakes, reduce development time by choosing the right tools and approaches, and ensure your project is built on a solid, future-proof foundation, ultimately saving time and money."
  - label: "How are project timelines estimated, and what happens if there are delays?"
    content: "Timelines are estimated based on the project scope, complexity, and required features. I provide a detailed breakdown of tasks and their estimated duration in the project plan. While I strive to meet all deadlines, unforeseen issues or scope changes can cause delays. In such cases, I maintain transparent communication, discuss the impact, and work with you to adjust the plan and mitigate further delays."
  - label: "What are the terms regarding intellectual property (IP) ownership for the developed software?"
    content: "Typically, upon full payment, the client owns the intellectual property rights to the custom code developed specifically for their project. Any pre-existing tools, libraries, or frameworks used remain the property of their respective owners. This will be clearly stated in our contract."
  - label: "How do you handle changes in project scope or requirements (scope creep)?"
    content: "Changes in scope are managed through a formal change request process. We'll discuss the requested changes, assess their impact on the timeline and budget, and provide a revised estimate. Approved changes will be documented and integrated into the project plan. This ensures transparency and avoids unexpected costs or delays."
